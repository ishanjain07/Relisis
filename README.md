A fully interactive system that allows users to access the nearest relief centre’s by using integration of geolocation, 
GPS and multimedia data collected from the user’s smartphone and using Social Information analysis of Facebook JSON data. 

The user will be able to share the content with other socialites in the social network. Our application is based on collecting Facebook 
JSON data and applying geotagging to the location of users to recreate safe and unsafe localities, and combines them with various social 
media analysis tools determine a centre to escape the flood and have access to the quickest path to pursue during floods or any other 
emergency situations. It provides an approximation of the nearest relief centre by using Google Maps and Street View API to determine 
the real life location of the user and point in the direction of all the relief centre’s being set up by The Indian government and help 
him reach there. Thus in times of natural calamities by applying various social Information analysis techniques we will be able to 
determine the relief centres by using Facebook JSON data and be able to mark themselves safe.
